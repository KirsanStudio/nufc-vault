    <section class="history-section">
      <h2>Club History</h2>
      <p>
        Newcastle United Football Club was formed in 1892 following the merger of
        Newcastle East End and Newcastle West End. The club has since become one of
        the most recognisable institutions in English football, representing not
        just a city, but an entire region.
      </p>
      <p>
        Newcastle enjoyed early success in the 1900s, winning multiple league titles
        and FA Cups, and later became known for attacking football during the Kevin
        Keegan era of the 1990s. While major silverware has often proved elusive in
        modern times, the club’s support has remained among the most passionate and
        loyal in the world.

    <!-- ST JAMES PARK -->
    <section class="history-section">
      <h2>St James’ Park</h2>
      <p>
        St James’ Park has been the home of Newcastle United since 1892. Situated in
        the heart of the city, it is one of the most iconic stadiums in English
        football, with a current capacity of over 52,000.
      </p>
      <p>
        Known for its towering stands and intense atmosphere, the stadium has hosted
        European nights, FA Cup ties, and unforgettable Premier League encounters.
        On matchdays, it dominates the city skyline — a constant reminder of football’s
        place in Newcastle life.
