      <h2>Club History</h2>

      <p>
        Newcastle United Football Club was formed in 1892 following the merger of Newcastle East End
        and Newcastle West End. From the earliest decades of league football through to the modern era,
        the club has been defined by identity, tradition, and a support base that extends far beyond the city.
      </p>

      <p>
        Over the decades, Newcastle have experienced periods of major success, near-misses, rebuilding,
        and revival. The club’s story includes famous title challenges, iconic players, legendary managers,
        and European nights that remain central to the folklore of St James’ Park.

    <!-- ST JAMES' PARK -->
    <section class="history-section">
      <h2>St James’ Park</h2>

      <p>
        St James’ Park has been Newcastle United’s home since 1892. Built into the city, rather than placed
        on its outskirts, it has a unique presence — towering over nearby streets and forming part of the
        skyline on matchdays.
      </p>

      <p>
        The stadium is known for its scale, steep stands, and the intensity of the atmosphere — particularly
        in the Gallowgate End. It has hosted domestic cup ties, European football, and some of the most
        memorable Premier League matches of the modern era.
